### **Module 5 (M5) - Spotify I**

*Purpose: What is Statistics/Data Science (DS) Question we want to answer?*
1. **Artist Album Release Patterns**: How has the number of albums released by each artist changed over the years?
- *Manipulation*: Group the data by artist and album release year, then count the number of albums.
- *Visualization*: Create a line graph showing the number of albums released per year for each artist.

```{r}
all_artists_df %>% 
  # distinct(artist, album, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%  # Remove duplicates based on artist and album
  group_by(artist_name, album_release_year) %>%  # Group by artist and album year
  summarise(count = n()) %>%  # Count the number of albums
  ggplot(aes(x = album_release_year, y = count, group = artist_name, color = artist_name)) +  # Plot album_year on x-axis and count on y-axis, group and color by artist
  geom_line() +  # Use line graph
  labs(title = "Artist Album Release Patterns Over the Years", x = "Year", y = "Number of Albums") +  # Add labels
  theme_custom()
```
