## Data Science Hackathon Video Series Outline

### **Video 1: Introduction to the Data Science Hackathon**

#### Overview of the Hackathon Process

The Data Science Hackathon is designed to engage high school students in the practical aspects of data science through a focused competition. Over the course of two weekends, participants will undergo a learning phase through instructional videos and can get help from mentors, followed by a weekend dedicated to applying their new skills in a hackathon format. This process aims to not only introduce students to the field of data science but also to challenge them to solve real-world problems using data from interesting domains like Spotify and sports.

#### Core Objectives of the Hackathon

1. **Igniting a Passion for Data Science: ** Launch high school students on an exhilarating journey into the world of programming and data science, setting the stage for future innovations and discoveries.

2. **Hands-On Experience with Authentic Data: ** Dive deep into the vast ocean of real-world data, where students will learn to navigate, analyze, and extract valuable insights from genuine datasets from intriguing domains like Spotify and sports.

3. **Collaboration and Mentorship: ** Foster a dynamic environment where students engage in an interactive project alongside mentors from Cal Poly. This collaboration is designed to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, encouraging students to solve complex problems through teamwork and expert guidance.

#### Foundational Skills in Programming and Data Science

Participants will gain essential skills in:
- Basic programming concepts and syntax, likely using R.
- Data manipulation and analysis using packages like dplyr and stringr (for R).
- Data visualization techniques using ggplot2 (for R).
- Understanding of how to approach data science problems from hypothesis to insight.

#### Introduction to Posit Cloud and Its Role in the Hackathon

Posit Cloud serves as the primary platform for the hackathon, providing an accessible, web-based environment for coding. It offers:
- An integrated development environment (IDE) for R and Python, removing the need for local software installation.
- Easy access to project workspaces, facilitating seamless collaboration among participants.
- A platform for mentors to share code snippets, instructional materials, and feedback in real-time.

#### How to Use Posit

Participants will learn to:
- Navigate the Posit Cloud interface to create and manage projects.
- Utilize the IDE for writing and executing code.
- Share projects with mentors for review and collaboration.
- Deploy applications or visualizations directly from Posit Cloud.

#### Mentorship and Support Available

Mentorship plays a crucial role in the hackathon, with support provided by:
- College students and professionals in data science, offering guidance through office hours and discussion forums.
- Structured feedback sessions, where participants can present their progress and receive constructive advice.
- Access to a repository of resources, including tutorials, datasets, and examples specifically curated for the hackathon challenges.

#### Quiz Engagement

- Complementing each video, you'll find a quiz designed to sharpen your newly acquired skills.
- Enjoy the freedom of unlimited attempts to ensure mastery of the material.
- Don't hesitate to reach out to your mentors for assistance and insights.

## Video specifications

Less than 10 minutes; Between 8 to 10 minutes

What did we learn aspect of the video or even notes?

Include intro video for each video with a little bit of hip-hop and the beginning.

Make the video exciting regarding getting the data and transforming it. In other words, I’m thinking of making the purpose of ETV regarding the video resonate with a question a student would ask about data.

Consistent thumb clip of data science image that’s captivating

Make videos in such a way that I can easily sell them to summer camps

include a sort of "appendix"/ glossary in the description of the video or in some type of handout given to participants of the hackathon that has the definitions for key terms such as "string" , "data frame" or "console". This way, if a student needs clarification on something they don't have to replay the video, they can reference the appendix. Not sure if this would always be helpful or how experienced the students are with R-Studio,

I’m thinking that I would like Students) to be able to either click on a description within YouTube or within the quiz that takes them to this glossary

Maybe use the GIFS that start 331 uses to display The action of the dplyr verbs

Let this glossary be a website

summary of the tools we used at the end of the series, or something like a "you learned how to..." Make this list cumulative after each video so that students are able to see how much they were able to accomplish

## Data science hackathon video questions

10 to 15 questions per video

most questions are coding questions, however, some questions ask Students) what is the purpose of certain functions

Ask Students) to correct the code so that it works

Or even change the code, so it does something a little different

or even realizations are even specifications of data types

Let questions be cumulative in difficulty, as well as reviewer in concepts from previous videos, so that students have a solidified understanding when they do the actual hackathon

Multiple-choice, coding, multiple answer

If there is a way for us to store their data within a secure database, that would be fantastic
